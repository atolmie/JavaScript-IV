// CODE here for your Lambda Classes
/*First we need a Person class. This will be our `base-class`
* Person receives `name` `age` `location` `gender` all as props
* Person receives `speak` as a method.
* This method logs out a phrase `Hello my name is Fred, I am from Bedrock` where `name` and `location` are the object's own props*/

class Person {
    constructor(attributes){
        this.newName = attributes.name;
        this .newAge = attributes.age;
        this.newLocation = attributes.location;
        this.newGender = attributes.gender;
    }
    speak() {
        return `${this.newName} says ${this.newLocation}`;
    }
}

/*### Instructor

* Now that we have a Person as our base class, we'll build our Instructor class.
* Instructor uses the same attributes that have been set up by Person
* Instructor has the following unique props:
  * `specialty` what the Instructor is good at i.e. 'redux'
  * `favLanguage` i.e. 'JavaScript, Python, Elm etc.'
  * `catchPhrase` i.e. `Don't forget the homies`
* Instructor has the following methods:
  * `demo` receives a `subject` string as an argument and logs out the phrase 'Today we are learning about {subject}' where subject is the param passed in.
  * `grade` receives a `student` object and a `subject` string as arguments and logs out '{student.name} receives a perfect score on {subject}' */
